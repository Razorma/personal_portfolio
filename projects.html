            Here is a webpage I recently created using Flexbox, which allowed me
            to easily and efficiently create a responsive layout for my content.

            different screen sizes and devices.

            customize it as needed to achieve the look and feel that I wanted.

            I recently worked on a project that calculates the total phone bill using DOM elements.
            The goal of the project was to create a simple and user-friendly web application that
            allows users to calculate their monthly phone bill.
